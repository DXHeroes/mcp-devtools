# AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when using Cursor IDE with AI assistance for MCP DevTools development:

## Effective AI Prompts

1. **Be Specific**

   - Include file paths and line numbers when referencing code
   - Specify the expected behavior, not just the task
   - Include relevant context (e.g., "This is part of the Jira MCP integration")

2. **Chunk Complex Tasks**

   - Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Ask for one implementation at a time
   - Verify each step before proceeding to the next

3. **Request Explanations**
   - Ask AI to explain its reasoning
   - Request documentation alongside implementation
   - Ask for alternative approaches when appropriate

## Code Review Assistance

1. **Request Focused Reviews**

   - Ask AI to review specific aspects (security, performance, etc.)
   - Provide the full context of the code being reviewed
   - Ask for specific improvements rather than general feedback

2. **Validation Assistance**
   - Ask AI to help write tests for your code
   - Request validation of edge cases
   - Use AI to check for potential bugs or edge cases

## Documentation Assistance

1. **Generate Documentation**

   - Ask AI to create or update README sections
   - Request JSDoc comments for functions
   - Use AI to help document complex algorithms

2. **Consistency**
   - Ask AI to ensure documentation follows the project standards
   - Request help maintaining consistent terminology
   - Use AI to check for documentation gaps

## Best Practices

1. **Always Review AI-Generated Code**

   - Check for correctness and appropriateness
   - Verify complex algorithms
   - Ensure it meets project standards

2. **Iterative Refinement**

   - Start with a basic implementation
   - Refine with more specific requirements
   - Use AI to help optimize the code

3. **Enhance, Don't Replace**
   - Use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement
   - Maintain ownership of the code
   - Understand the code AI generates
